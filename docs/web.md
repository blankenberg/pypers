Pypers web interface
======

Pypers provides an out of the box submission and monitoring tool


Once a pipilen json specification is added to the pipeline library, the front-end is able to render a submission page from the spec
E.g.  
![submission page](/docs/images/pypers_submission.png)


All submitted pipelines can be monitored from the web front-end
![monitoring page](/docs/images/pypers_monitoring.png)

You can see logs, result files, job status
